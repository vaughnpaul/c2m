ULTIMATE FORM MAIL (EVALUATION AND NON-EVALUATION) 

THE SUMMARY (or easy to understand version):

The full license agreement as set out below relating to the evaluation and
non-evaluation versions of ULTIMATE FORM MAIL will at all times be the legal
agreement that relates to your use of ULTIMATE FORM MAIL.

In summary, ULTIMATE FORM MAIL is licensed per website,
based on the website address. You can make limited backups and keep those
offsite if necessary.

Product support is given via online support tickets, discussion forum, and 
occasional direct emails. 

The product is likely to change over time, and non-major upgrades may be
distributed for free. These will generally be features that we wanted to
include in the very beginning but that time constraints just didn't
allow. Should the product take on a new direction, then upgrade fees may
apply. Suggestions are also welcome, and may become incorporated into the
product.
